# DiabetesPrediction
This is a project containing my submitted and approved technical projects for my Data science and data analysis course with Poise Finishing academy.

In this project, I and my team members evaluated the performance of four classification models; logistic regression, random forest classifier, support vector classifier (svc), and gradient boosting classifier.
Also, we created a Power BI dashboard to gain insight and predictions based on the patterns and relationships within the dataset.

The diabetes prediction project aims to develop an accurate predictive model to detect diabetes in patients based on several health-related features.
Evaluated the performance of four classification models; Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting classifier to identify the optimal model for diabetes prediction with the Gradient Boosting Classifier achieving the highest Accuracy Score of 90%.
Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize key relationships within the data and a PowerPoint presentation to explain the model's findings in clear and concise terms, receiving positive feedback from project supervisor.
